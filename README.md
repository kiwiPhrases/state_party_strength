# Data on party strength in each US state
The repository contains data on party strength for each state as shown on each state's corresponding party strength Wikipedia page.

Each state has a table of a detailed summary of the state of its governing and representing bodies on Wikipedia but there is no data set that collates these entries. I scraped each state's Wikipedia table and collated the entries into a single dataset. The data are stored in the **state_party_strength.csv** and the code that generated the file can be found in Python notebook. 

Hope it proves as useful to you as it proved to me.
